abstract = {Certain classes of infinite groups arising from geometry and topology are known to have solvable word problem. We describe the development of practical methods for the solution of the word problem based on the reduction of words in the generators to a normal form. The Knuth-Bendix completion procedure is the principal tool used but, in the case that this process does not halt, we use alternative methods involving the construction of finite-state automata. A computer implementation of these procedures together with some performance statistics on some simple examples are also described.}

abstract = {From the Publisher:This study in combinatorial group theory introduces the concept of automatic groups. It contains a succinct introduction to the theory of regular languages, a discussion of related topics in combinatorial group theory, and the connections between automatic groups and geometry which motivated the development of this new theory. It is of interest to mathematicians and computer scientists and includes open problems that will dominate the research for years to come.}
