\section{Introduction}

The figure on the cover page is a hyperbolic tiling of the Poincar\'e
disk, which is a model of the hyperbolic plane. If the readers are
reading a PDF version of this article, they can zoom in the cover
figure to explore the exquisite detail on the boundary: there are more
than $179,900$ black triangles in total.

In this article I briefly introduce the mathematical principles behind
the figure and explain the algorithm which generates it, just like
\citep{silvio1992}. The generation of these types of triangular tiling
graphics is the combination of geometry, group theory and
deterministic finite automata. Nothing here is new. I just want to
elucidate the elegance of mathematics hidden beneath this stunning
figure.

  \label{fig:hyplines}
\end{figure}

Hyperbolic geometry is a non-Euclidean geometry which satisfies all of
Euclid's postulates except the parallel postulate. The parallel
postulate in hyperbolic geometry is: For any given infinite straight
line $L$ and point $P$ not on $L$, in the plane containing both $L$
and $P$ there are \emph{at least two} distinct infinitely extending
straight lines through $P$ that do not intersect $L$.


The Poincar\'e disk is one of many models of 2-dimensional hyperbolic
geometry (a.k.a.\ \emph{hyperbolic plane}). A \emph{model} means a
choice of an underlying space, together with a choice of the
representation of basic geometric objects, such as points and lines,
in this space. The underlying space of the Poincar\'e disk model is
the open unit disk
\begin{equation}
  \mathbb{D} = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2\mid x^2 + y^2 < 1\}
\end{equation}
The points in the Poincar\'e disk are the interior points of the unit
circle. The straight lines are circular arcs which are orthogonal to
the unit circle. For example, the lines $PP'$, $QQ'$, $RR'$ and $PS$
in Figure~\ref{fig:hyplines} are all ``straight'' lines which meet the
rim at right angles. Notice that if a line passes through the center
$O$ like $QQ'$, it remains straight. This is the special case of a
``circular arc'' whose radius is infinite. The points on the rim do
not belong to $\mathbb{D}$. So lines $PP'$ and $PS$ are \emph{limiting
parallel}: They never touch, but their points get closer and closer
together. There are many other pairs of lines, like $PP'$ and $QQ'$,
or $PP'$ and $RR'$, that are totally disjoint or \emph{ultraparallel},
in the sense that their points never become arbitrarily close. This
model does satisfy the parallel postulate in hyperbolic geometry:
through a point $T$ which is not on line $PP'$, lines $PS$ and $QQ'$
both do not intersect $PP'$. Actually through $T$ there are an
infinite number of coplanar lines that do not intersect $PP'$. From
now, we no longer distinguish the Poincar\'e disk model $\mathbb{D}$
and the hyperbolic plane.


Then it is time to consider some quantitative properties of the
hyperbolic plane. Any point in $\mathbb{D}$ can be seen as a complex
number $z=x + \iu y$ satisfying $\lvert z \rvert < 1$. For any two
points $w, z \in \mathbb{D}$, the \emph{hyperbolic distance} between
$w$ and $z$ is defined by:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:distance}
  d(w, z) = 2\tanh^{-1}\left\lvert\frac{w-z}{1-w\overline{z}}\right\rvert
\end{equation}
where $\tanh^{-1}(x) = \dfrac{1}{2}\ln\dfrac{1+x}{1-x}$, $\lvert
\cdot\rvert$ is the complex absolute value, and $\overline{z}$ is the
complex conjugate. It is easy to see $\displaystyle\lim_{z\rightarrow
  1}d(0,z)=\infty$, which means the hyperbolic distance from the
center to the rim of $\mathbb{D}$ is infinity. Intuitively, if a man
living on $\mathbb{D}$ walks from the center to the rim at a constant
pace, he would never reach the rim. From an outsider's view, he walks
slower and slower while getting smaller and smaller. For this man, the
$\mathbb{D}$ is the whole infinite world! In contrast, the hyperbolic
angles in $\mathbb{D}$ are just Euclidean angles.

  \caption{Triangles and Reflections of the Hyperbolic Plane $\mathbb{D}$}
  \label{fig:tri}
\end{figure}


Analogous to reflection in the Euclidean plane, reflection in the
hyperbolic plane is the inversion of a circle. Take
Figure~\ref{fig:tri} as an example, an inversion with respect to a
reference circle with center $O'$ and radius $r$ maps a point $O$ to
point $C$, which lies on the ray from $O'$ through $O$ such that
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:inversion}
  \lVert O'O \rVert \times \lVert O'C \rVert= r^2
\end{equation}
where $\lVert \cdot \rVert$ is the Euclidean distance. The same
inversion also takes $C$ back to $O$ since
equation~\eqref{eqn:inversion} is symmetric. Inversion has many nice
properties. It maps circles or lines to other circles or lines and it
also preserves the angles between crossing curves. More importantly,
it preserves the hyperbolic distance defined in
\eqref{eqn:distance}. For example, we have $d(O, A)=d(A, C)$ in
Figure~\ref{fig:tri}. So the \emph{hyperbolic reflection} with respect
to a hyperbolic line $AB$ is the inversion with respect to the circle
$O'$. Similarly, line $AC$ reflects $B$ to $D$ and line $CD$ reflects
$A$ to $E$. So all triangles in Figure~\ref{fig:tri} are congruent:
their corresponding sides are equal in hyperbolic length, and their
corresponding angles are equal in measure. Actually all triangles on
the cover figure, no matter black or white, are congruent. They are
all generated by sequences of hyperbolic reflections across the sides
of a single, initial triangle. They form a triangular tiling of the
hyperbolic plane $\mathbb{D}$.

\section{M\"obius Triangle and Triangle Group}

The triangle that can be used to tile the entire Euclidean plane,
hyperbolic plane or sphere through reflections in its sides without
any gaps or overlaps is called M\"obius triangle. A M\"obius triangle
can be represented by a triple of positive integers $(p, q, r)$ which
means the vertex angles are $\pi/p$, $\pi/q$, and $\pi/r$
repectively. Figure~\ref{fig:tri236} shows a $(2, 3, 6)$ triangle
$ABC$ and the tiled pattern via reflections. The forward and backward
letter ``F''s indicate the different orientations of the triangles,
just like the black and white triangles of the cover figure. From the
pattern, we can see that there are 4, 6, 12 triangles surrounding
vertices $A$, $B$, $C$ respectively. In general, there are $2p$, $2q$,
$2r$ surrounding triangles of each vertex of a M\"obius triangle $(p,
q, r)$ since a complete angle is $2\pi$. Based on this principle, it
can be determined that the M\"obius triangle of the cover figure is
$(5, 5, 2)$.

  \caption{The $(2, 3, 6)$ Triangle Tiling}
  \label{fig:tri236}
\end{figure}

A simple condition can be used to determine in which geometry a
M\"obius triangle can tile. If $1/p + 1/q + 1/r = 1$, the triangle can
tile the Euclidean plane. If the sum of reciprocals is greater than 1,
the triangle can tile a sphere. A hyperbolic M\"obius triangle must
satisfy the following condition:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mobtri}
  \frac{1}{p} + \frac{1}{q} + \frac{1}{r} < 1
\end{equation}
The inequation~\eqref{eqn:mobtri} is a straightforward consequence of
the fact that the sum of the angles of any hyperbolic triangle is
strictly less than a straight angle.

The pattern in Figure~\ref{fig:tri236} can also be seen as a parital
geometric realization of a \emph{triangle group} whose elements are
compositions of reflections $a$, $b$ and $c$ in the three sides of
triangle $ABC$. Given any M\"obius triangle $(p, q, r)$, the group
generated by reflections across its sides is called $(p, q, r)$
triangle group. The number of elements of a triangle group equals the
number of copies of the original triangle in the whole pattern,
because there is a unique isometry in the group taking the original
triangle to any other triangle. An isometry is a distance-preserving
bijective transformation between metric spaces. All reflections in
various geometries are isometries, so as their compositions.

A triangle group has a presentation in terms of its generators and
relations. The three generator $a$, $b$ and $c$ have order 2 since
they are reflections. The composition of two reflections in lines
meeting at an angle $\alpha$ is a rotation by $2\alpha$ about the
intersection of the two lines. Thus $ab$, $bc$, and $ca$ are rotations
by $2\pi/p$, $2\pi/q$, and $2\pi/r$ and hence have order $p$, $q$ and
$r$. So the following relations hold:
\begin{equation*}
  a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = 1,\, (ab)^p = (bc)^q = (ca)^r = 1
\end{equation*}
There is a theorem saying that all other relations between $a$, $b$
and $c$ can be expressed in terms of relations above. So the triangle
group admits a group presentation
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:prtn}
  \langle a, b, c \mid a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = (ab)^p = (bc)^q = (ca)^r = 1\rangle
\end{equation}
Informally, a group presentation $\langle S \mid R \rangle$ with
generator sets $S$ and relation sets $R$ like \eqref{eqn:prtn}
specifies a group whose element has the form
\begin{equation*}
  s_1^{a_1}s_2^{a_2}\dots s_n^{a_n}
\end{equation*}
where $s_i\in S$ and $a_i$ are non-zero integers. Particularly, $a_i$
is positive in the group presented by \eqref{eqn:prtn}, since
$s_i^2=1$ indicates $s_i^{-1}=s_i$. Such a form is called a
\emph{word} of the group. An element may have many equivalent words if
$R$ is not empty. For example, $ab^3c=abc$ since $b^2=1$ in
\eqref{eqn:prtn}. If $S$ is finite, the group is \emph{finitely
generated}. If both $S$ and $R$ are finite sets, we say that the group
is \emph{finitely presented}.

A natural question is: for a particular group $\langle S \mid R
\rangle$, is there an algorithm to decide whether two words are the
same element or not? It is called the \emph{word problem} for
groups. In general, it is undecidable
\citep{novikov1958algorithmic}. However, the word problem for triangle
groups is solvable. This is the reason why we can generate the
hyperbolic triangle tilings efficiently.

\section{Automatic Groups and Automata}
The word problem for triangle groups involves the theory of
\emph{automatic groups}, developed by David Epstein, Jim Cannon, Bill
Thurston and others \citep{epstein1992}. An automatic group is a
finitely generated group equipped with several finite-state
automata. Those automata can be used to tell if a given word is some
sort of ``canonical form'' and tell if two canonical words differ by a
generator.

All triangle groups are automatic groups, which means we can generate
triangle tilings by enumerating the elements of the group that map the
initial triangle somewhere via the equipped automata. Furthermore, the
triangle group is \emph{short-lex automatic}. It means the
``canonical-formed'' words that can be enumerated are the minimal
words in short-lex order. Among all words representing the same group
element, the minimal word in short-lex order is the word with minimal
length and the firt one in lexicographical order.

The practical algorithm to find the automatic structure of a triangle
group is described in \citep{epstein1991}, whose major component is
Knuth--Bendix completion algorithm. The good news is that we do not
need to implement this complicated algorithm. There is a
GAP\citep{GAP4} package called \verb|kbmag| (Knuth-Bendix on Monoids
and Automatic Groups) that can help us to enumerate words and
transforming an arbitrary word to its normal (i.e.\ minimal in
short-lex order) form.
